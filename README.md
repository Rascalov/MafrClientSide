# Moodle Automatic File Retriever Client
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rascalov/Rascalov.github.io/master/gif/DownloadUpdate.gif">


A client that allows the user to access the Inholland Moodle environment. This was inspired by my original Console app
with sharing its namesake.

I made a small write up/rant on the creation of the MAFR client and server:
https://rascalov.github.io/#moodle-automatic-file-retriever-mafr


Client contents and benefits:
* Graphical User interface
* Light-weight application
* NO LOG IN REQUIRED
* Download and update multiple courses at the same time

I have tested a lot of courses, all of which have shown positive download and update results.

The Client also creates a snapshot.html of all items per Moodle course section. 
This allows the user to still have access to resources that can't be downloaded such as:

* assignments
* group links
* embedded text without files
* for more, visit the write up



## The GUI
